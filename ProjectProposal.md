## Project Proposal

### Project Title

**Product Inventory Management System**

### Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a user-friendly, single-page web application that displays a grid of products fetched from a local database. Users will be able to search, filter, and sort products, as well as toggle between dark and light modes. This application aims to provide an efficient tool for managing and exploring product data.

### Features

1. **Responsive Grid Layout**: Products will be displayed in a grid format that adjusts according to the screen size.
2. **Search Functionality**: Users can search for products by name, enhancing discoverability.
3. **Category Filtering**: Users can filter products based on their category to streamline browsing.
4. **Price Sorting**: Users can sort products by price to find items within their budget quickly.
5. **Theme Toggle**: Users can switch between dark and light themes for a personalized experience.

### Technical Requirements

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: `json-server` for serving the product data from a `db.json` file
- **API**: Local REST API provided by `json-server`, returning at least 5 product objects, each with attributes such as `id`, `name`, `category`, and `price`.
- **Image Handling**: Product images displayed within the grid to enhance visual appeal.

### Tools and Technologies

- **HTML5**: For structuring the web pages.
- **CSS3**: For styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: For interactivity and data manipulation, including event listeners for user actions.
- **json-server**: For creating a mock REST API that will handle asynchronous requests and return JSON data.

### Implementation Plan

1. **Setup Environment**
   - Install `json-server` and initialize the project structure with necessary files (`index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`).

2. **Design Layout**
   - Create the HTML structure in `index.html` and style the application in `styles.css` to implement a responsive grid layout for displaying products.

3. **Develop Functionality**
   - Write JavaScript code in `script.js` to:
     - Fetch data from `json-server` asynchronously.
     - Handle user interactions through at least 3 distinct event listeners (e.g., for search, filter, and theme toggle).
     - Manipulate and display the fetched data using array methods (e.g., `filter`, `map`).

4. **Testing**
   - Test the application for responsiveness across different screen sizes and devices.
   - Verify that all features (search, filter, sorting, theme toggle) work as intended without redirects or reloads.

5. **Documentation**
   - Prepare a README file detailing setup instructions, usage, and features of the application.

6. **Deployment**
   - Host the static files on a web server or a service like GitHub Pages to share the application publicly.

### Deliverables

- A fully functional single-page web application with the outlined features.
- Source code hosted on GitHub, ensuring no sensitive information (like API keys) is included.
- Comprehensive documentation including a README file with setup and usage instructions.
